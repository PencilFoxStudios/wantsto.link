/**
 * Y'know, for what it's worth, TypeScript is a really useful programming language. Sometimes I like it,
 * but other times it makes me want to reconsider my line of work. This is a perfect example!
 *
 * Why is this file required??? Have we really gotten so backwards to the point where computers forgot what a
 * fucking image file was? To the point where I have to spoon-feed the compiler its image-recognizing medication
 * because it's too demented to understand what browsers have already understood since 1995??? You'd think some
 * assumptions would be made here for a language that's SUPPOSED to be all about smart typing!!!
 *
 * But no. I have to sit here, and waste my time writing this nothingburger of a file because this McDonalds
 * Dollar Menu Walmart Great Value Spirit Airlines Go fare of a programming language forgot what a damn png was.
 *
 * "TS2307: Cannot find module ./assets/yiptoyellow.png or its corresponding type declarations."
 *
 * I'll shove my foot up your ass.
